# The Porter hypothesis: Environmental regulations, innovation, and productivity
I study at the Georg-August University of Goettingen for the development economics master's program. Here is the R script that I used for one of my research papers that examined the impact of environmental regulations on innovations and productivity. 

## Abstract
To fight against climate change and mitigate its devastating consequences, governments worldwide have been using various policy tools. This term paper tests the weak and narrow versions of the Porter Hypothesis using a panel
dataset of 1032 data from 33 OECD countries between 1990 and 2021. The newly constructed Environmental Policy Stringency index is used to test both versions. A fixed effect model is estimated and revealed that environmental regulations positively affect innovation across countries, measured by their R&D expenditure and the number of patents. For the narrow hypothesis, market-based or flexible regulations induce more innovation compared to the non-market-based regulation.
